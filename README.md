> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or

> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.

Zenscrape is a web scraping API that returns the rendered HTML of any target URL while handling proxy rotation, headless-browser JavaScript rendering, geotargeting, and Cloudflare protection. A single GET /get request fetches a page through a rotating pool of standard or premium residential proxies, with a /status endpoint for remaining credits and an HTTP proxy-mode interface for existing proxy-based clients.
